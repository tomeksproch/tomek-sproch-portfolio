      My interest in programming started at a young age when I created a blog
      about games using a website creator with a friend. Since then, my passion
      for programming has only grown. I spend all my free time practicing and
      learning. As a good team player, I enjoy working collaboratively to
      achieve goals, which may come from my second passion, football. This
      website represents the path that I have taken so far in my journey as a
      programmer.
